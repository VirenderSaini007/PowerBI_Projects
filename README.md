For this "Veeru_Northwind_Project" project the Data is imported from Odata service.
link for data https://services.odata.org/Northwind/Northwind.svc/
The Northwind database contains the sales data for a fictitious company called “Northwind Traders,” which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. It contains many tales related to each other, I imported only those tables which are enough to get insight about sales, orders, employees, customers, category and products and regions.
